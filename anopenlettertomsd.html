        <h1>An Open Letter To MS Dhoni</h1>
        <h2>By Abhishek Ajish</h2>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Dear Mahi,



            I remember watching you land a Kookaburra cricket ball into the hearts of 125 crore Indians on a Sunday
            evening in 2011 at Mumbai. That day when a young boy from Kerala for the first time witnessed you, who
            perhaps changed the way he looked at his life.


            <br><br><br>
            Fast forward to more than a thousand days later, here I am still screeching, failing to come to terms to the
            fact that the greatest player to have ever graced our game, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has asked to ‘consider me
            Retired’.

            <br><br><br>

            Tell you what?? I always knew you were going to end it this way. When we are all busy with our work and
            suddenly a notification would pop up in our mobile reading “MS Dhoni has retired from International
            Cricket”, and you did that exactly in the ‘Mahi way’ we all knew. No farewell match, no press conference, no
            guard of honour, no decorations. I knew you would leave us just like that. For a country that's known for
            its flamboyance and its obsession for the limelight and then you to do something like this?? You surely have
            got to be built out of something else.

            <br><br><br>

            You always exemplified a true leader and how he should be when you were always the first one ready to face
            the media during the team’s rough patches and was always humble enough to send a teammate when the team
            tastes victory. As long as those sixes kept on flowing from your Spartan bat, Indians slept well. And the
            very next match if they don't, we sprint on to Ranchi in front of your residence, burn your models and do
            everything that could degrade a national icon to its fullest.
            <br><br><br>


            Everytime you step on to the turf wearing our blue and orange, I turn out to be a ball of goosebumps. Trust
            me when I say that I am not a man of goosebumps, but when I write this the hair at the back of my neck is
            all live and who knows they might be chanting “Dhoniii!! Dhonii!!”
            <br><br><br>
            Your journey has inspired millions of aspiring sportsmen all across the globe and it just fills my heart
            with joy and pride that I was born in this generation that was lucky enough to see the great Mahendra Singh
            Dhoni.

            <br><br><br>

            Lieutenant Colonel Mahendra Singh Dhoni, I salute you with utmost devotion and everlasting love for you and
            your eternal craft.

            <br><br>

            - A fanboy who might as well chant “Dhoniii Dhoniiiiii” on his deathbed.
