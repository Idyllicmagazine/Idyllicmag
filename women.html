        <h1>Women</h1>
        <h2>By Afua</h2>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
            Intro:

            <br><br><br>

            Gina Carey once said “A Strong Woman Looks A Challenge Dead In The Eye And Gives It A Wink.” Gina Carey’s
            quote truly defines what being a woman in society is really all about. WOMEN. According to the dictionary, a
            woman is defined as a female adult. But pondering upon this question, that's not who we are. This definition
            does not capture the real stance on what it is like to be a woman in America. Women are one of these
            greatest beings on this earth. Through challenges and struggles we've been through, we become united and
            one.


            <br><br><br>
            Beginning of history and breaking through:

            <br><br>

            Throughout history, women were seen as housewives. We were seen as a fundamental piece in a household, but
            were never given the option to leave this position. With no access to an education, women weren’t given the
            tools to succeed as we do now. But in history, being a housewife defined who we are and it was time to break
            those stereotypes. Women fought for years to not be defined just as housewives, but also to be able to do
            what men could do, work, get an education, and vote. With our voices shouting day and night through the dark
            storm brewing, we can fast forward 100 years and be proud of where we made it too. Our brain works like no
            other, it's unique and special.


            <br><br><br>


            Issues women face today:

            <br><br>

            Sexual harassment is arguably the biggest issue women face today. It has been an issue women have faced for
            years but has constantly been swept under the rug, but through social media movements like the MeToo
            movement, we have been able to bring more attention to the growing issue. We will not be silenced. RAINN
            created a hotline for victims of sexual harassment. If you or someone that you know is a victim, please do
            not be afraid to call. (800) 656-4673


            <br><br><br>
            Another issue women face today is the growing gender pay gap, another issue that has been getting attention.
            In 2018, women of all races earned, on average, just 82 cents for every $1 earned by men of all races. After
            years of hard work to not be seen as just a housewife, we are still paid less. As the Equal Pay for Equal
            Work movement grows, you best believe women will start earning the same amount of money men do.

            <br><br><br>

            Conclusion:

            <br><br><br>

            As women, we have tackled various issues. Truly, women have changed the world. Through inventions, protests,
            activists, teachers, doctors, lawyers, authors, and more, women have redefined the structures of society.
            From Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat to Maya Angelou voicing her words through writing, women have
            been one of the most influential beings to exist. We are honest and real, never afraid to do the right thing
            and stand up for what we believe in. Our creativity and imaginations are unlike no other. Yes we still face
            issues today, but we will use our voices to overcome them.
