            Trigger Warning: this article discusses mental health, including depression, anxiety and suggestions towards
            suicide. Resources can be found at the end of the article for those seeking help and advice.

            Mental Health: that word right there speaks a thousand words. It's one the most powerful words ever written
            or spoken.
            <br><br>
            What is Mental Health?
            <br><br>
            According to the dictionary, mental health is defined as your social, emotional and psychological
            well-being. However, pondering upon this question, it doesn't capture the true essence of the phrase.
            <br><br>
            Imagine this: pre-Covid-19, you wake up at 6 am, Monday morning. You guessed it: a school day. Sitting on
            the hard stool, back aching for decade-long hours as the voice of your teacher echoes through one ear and
            out the other. You stare at the clock, watching the hand move slower and slower and slower -- STOP.
            <br><br>
            On a scale from 1-10, how irritated did that make you feel? Did you feel as though you were teleported back
            to a place you wish you didn’t have to go?. If you said yes, then you’re in good company with the majority
            of young students. But, the question we must be asking is, why do we feel this way? I would argue that it is
            because school has a detrimental effect on our mental health. So … how have our schools addressed these
            issues?
            <br><br><br>
            For me, my mental health has always been comparable to a perfect morning. A sunny day, birds chirping,
            flowers bright - I think you get the point. I’m a bubbly, fun person, that is until I go to school. For me,
            high school hasn't been my cup of tea. Waking up at 5:45, leaving my house at 6:30, walking in the dark as I
            feel the weight of my backpack creeping up my shoulder reminding me that this will be a dreadful day. It was
            surveyed that college students stated that mental health interfered with their studies, according to a
            American College Health Association 2015 study. As a result, this negatively impacted their academic
            performance; stress (30% of students), Anxiety (22%), Sleep difficulties (20%) & Depression (14%). So...what
            does our education system do about these numbers?
            <br><br><br>
            As I walked down the halls, the empty walls gazed at me, as I saw my reflection and thought back to easier
            times: middle school. I felt a sense of relief, seeing the walls filled with positive messages here. That
            feeling was like no other. BRRRRRRNGG BRRRRNGGG - suddenly, I found myself back in reality, watching kids
            finishing up their homework, copying answers of course as they head to class, the others looking dead as if
            in the zombie apocalypse but they didn’t want to run.
            <br><br><br>
            Now, don’t get me wrong, schools have guidance counselors. These are staff members who are paid to care
            about our feelings. The words “My door is open open” or “I’m here to listen” is what you typically imagine.
            Students, however, tend to use their guidance counselor for school related activities, such as college
            recommendations or changing schedules.
            <br><br><br>
            When students are feeling overwhelmed, stressed or anxious, they deal with what is known as self-diagnosing,
            the act of detecting if you have a disease or disorder without a certified official. An article from the
            Journal of Abnormal Psychology showcased that “between 2005 and 2017, the proportion of teens 12-17 who
            reported the symptoms of a major depressive episode within the last year rose from 8.7 percent to 13.2
            percent”. This idea of self-diagnosing is common, especially in mental health disorders, but how does our
            school or guidance counsellors address it? When we start to feel ‘bleh’ or lose interest in what we enjoyed,
            that may be a sign of depression. If so, what could you really do? Talk to your guidance who has lines of
            students waiting outside her door, with burning questions? What makes me so important?
            <br><br><br>
            Dory, yes, the fish, famously said “just keep swimming.” Swimming is like walking, once you learn you never
            forget. But, one day, I’m worried, I’ll forget. Mental health only becomes an issue when someone feels like
            they are underwater and instead of rising up, they decide they will be better off below.
            <br><br><br>
            When given homework, assignments and tests, every day, all week, these drowning feelings only increase. We
            do all this work just to be able to…...what, get a job? If you had to say what you want to do right now, and
            you couldn't change it for the rest of your life, what would you say?
            <br><br><br>
            Did you say doctor or lawyer, or was it your parents saying it? The reason we work so hard, the reason we
            stress ourselves staying up until 1 am, is because we can’t bear to imagine the pain of letting the people
            who risked everything for us down. Countless nights, staying up just floating in the water, staring at the
            stars, hoping to make a wish.
            <br><br><br>
            For me, I always thought I was doing medicine for my parents. I felt as if my parents were sinking me and I
            tried to get back up, but for some reason I couldn’t.I didn’t have the ability to let them down. Homework
            screams danger in my mind, pulling all nighter seems useless, yet, we all do it. This can lead to various
            cancers, Alzheimer's, and can make it easier for you to get a heart attack as stated in the Proceedings of
            National Academy of Sciences. The mindset that anxiety, depression, stress, and all, isn’t a big deal- that
            mentality should be eradicated because it is indeed called sinking.
